This quarantine is just at the first stage, but soon people will crave to go out for multiple reasons (walk, running, take the dog out...) and most of all avoid getting crazy at home. But there is no system that allows to understand how many people are gathered in a specific place. </p>\n<h3>👨‍🔬Hypothesis</h3>\n<p>This could be a Waze-like application where people inform where they are (it could even be anonymous, people just need to know the level of exposure) and for how long.\nThis will allow people to make decisions on where to go and when and also help police, ambulances and cameras better manage public places and gatherings.\nEven if, with the existence of this application, people are not conscious and civil, it could evolve into a ticketing system, where people make reservations.</p>\n<h3>🤔 Assumptions</h3>\n<h2>💻Implementation Suggestion</h2>\n<h3>V1</h3>\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<h3>What it is not</h3>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<h3>Data/Experiments</h3>\n<h2>💪 Impact of Potential Solution</h2>\n<h2>🙌 Criteria for Success</h2>\n<h2>😅 Known Issues</h2>\n<h2>✅ \"I've read this\" section</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Status</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Read/Not Read</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","headings":[{"depth":2,"value":"📃 Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why"},{"depth":3,"value":"💥 Problem"},{"depth":3,"value":"👨‍🔬Hypothesis"},{"depth":3,"value":"🤔 Assumptions"},{"depth":2,"value":"💻Implementation Suggestion"},{"depth":3,"value":"V1"},{"depth":3,"value":"What it is"},{"depth":3,"value":"What it is not"},{"depth":3,"value":"Design"},{"depth":3,"value":"Data/Experiments"},{"depth":2,"value":"💪 Impact of Potential Solution"},{"depth":2,"value":"🙌 Criteria for Success"},{"depth":2,"value":"😅 Known Issues"},{"depth":2,"value":"✅ \"I've read this\" section"}],"frontmatter":{"path":"/projects/software/location_crowdsourcing","title":"Location Crowdsourcing"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
