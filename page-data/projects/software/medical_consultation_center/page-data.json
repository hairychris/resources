Even volonteers can be overloaded.</li>\n<li>Also chaos can be a problem. We need a CRM feature to fix it</li>\n<li>Calls can be expansive. (maybe SMS too?) </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>👨‍🔬Hypothesis</h3>\n<p>So, the app (check idea) can be a solution</p>\n<h3>🤔 Assumptions</h3>\n<p>We can manage to create it!</p>\n<h2>💻Implementation Suggestion</h2>\n<p>Microservice app with different parts, can be developed in async mode:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UI - webclient</li>\n<li>mobile apps (packed webUI?)</li>\n<li>CRM backend</li>\n<li>VoIP microservice</li>\n<li>flask(?)</li>\n<li>SQL</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>V1</h3>\n<p>In first version we can skip mobile clients, and provide a basic CRM, ticket-management features</p>\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>TBD</p>\n<h3>What it is not</h3>\n<p>TBD</p>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<p>Let's discuss it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we can use SaaS API, like twilio (not AD!), amazon lambda, amazon S3, amazon rds. Can be vendor-lock problem, especially if service down because quarantine</li>\n<li>we can use stadalone solutions like kubernetes (and easy deploy in each cloud), and asterisk </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Data/Experiments</h3>\n<p>TBD</p>\n<h2>💪 Impact of Potential Solution</h2>\n<p>TBD</p>\n<h2>🙌 Criteria for Success</h2>\n<p>TBD</p>\n<h2>😅 Known Issues</h2>\n<p>We need a team, and we have to choose design.\nGood idea to merge with another project: <a href=\"https://github.com/Helpful-Engineers/resources/blob/master/software/proposals/web_medical_call_center.md\">https://github.com/Helpful-Engineers/resources/blob/master/software/proposals/web_medical_call_center.md</a></p>\n<h2>✅ \"I've read this\" section</h2>\n<p>Add in the table below the people you definitely want their eyes on this proposal.
